# NewsApp_Flask

# Project Overview
- We all have come across multiple Apps which provides news in a short and summarized format to the user. The news is showcased in 60-100 words summary , which is easy to read and grasp.
- Keeping the above concept in mind. I have built a web app which provides real time news in a short summarized format based on differnt sections such as Politics, Sports , Finance , Entertainment.
- This Web app demonstrate the ability to web scrap real time data from Google news API , clean the data, process and summarize it using python and NLP concepts.
- Initial idea was to use BERT based summarizer but due to hardware limitations on my local system. i have used Newspaper3k based summarizer but i have attached a python file to those who want to use BERT in the current project . All you have to do is replace the exisiting code with the one in the python file.
- News have been limited to top 5 in the existing project.
